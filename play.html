    <h3>A Woman of no Importance </h3>

    <h5>ACT II. _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.</h5>


    <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">My dear!</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>
    <p class="speech allonby">Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years. He can’t help himself. It is in his race. The History of Woman is very different. We have always been picturesque protests against
        the mere existence of common sense. We saw its dangers from the first.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most, most trying. Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband. I think it would be so very, very helpful.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>
    <p class="speech allonby">The Ideal Husband? There couldn’t be such a thing. The institution is wrong.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">He would probably be extremely realistic.</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>
    <p class="speech allonby">The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us
        to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">But how could he do both, dear?</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>
    <p class="speech allonby">He should never run down other pretty women. That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much. No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract him.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY STUTFIELD.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about other women.</p>

    <h4 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h4>
    <p class="speech allonby">If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got. But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that
        we have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we don’t want.</p>

    <h4 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h4>
    <p class="speech LADYSTUTFIELD">As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments.</p>
