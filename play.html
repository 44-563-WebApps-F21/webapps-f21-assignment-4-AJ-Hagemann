    <h3>A Woman of no Importance </h3>

    <h5>ACT II.  _The Drawing-room at Hunstanton Chase_.</h5>

    <p>LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!

        MRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a
        sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t
        help himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very
        different.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere
        existence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.
        
        LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,
        most trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think
        it would be so very, very helpful.
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The
        institution is wrong.
        
        LADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if
        we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse
        all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should
        encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should
        always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he
        says.
        
        LADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would
        show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he
        should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract
        him.
        
        LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about
        other women.
        
        MRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us
        an answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for
        whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,
        quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never
        dreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of
        useful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us
        everything we don’t want.
        
        LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills
        and compliments.
